# **IITB SOFT-Staller**
----------------------------------------------

Sorry, I couldn't come up with a better name.

What this software does
-------------------

This software is made specifically for freshies, to help them configure their laptops for various basic tasks that they need to do to utilize insti services, like DC++ and <b>IP Configuration</b>

Feature available till now
--------------------------

TBH, I have not added many features that I planned to add. Sorry for that. Here is a list of features that are their in the software.
1.	DC++
1.	LDAP Configuration
1.	IITB-Wireless Configuration
1.	DC++ auto file upload

What I planned to add and will add in few days...
1.	Timetable (as suggested by seniors of mine)
1.	Software downloader and @u70 cr@ck3r \<probably I will not add this>
1.	CS-Go auto IP configuration

How to Install
---------------

Installation process is pretty simple. 
1.	Download the **Setup.py** from here or directly from [This Link](https://homepages.iitb.ac.in/~vaibhaw/Setup.zip)
2.  Unzip it, inside it should be a **setup.exe** file. Open it in administrator mode, and other processes should be simple (I hope)

What other things you should do
----------------------------------
I would recommend you to download a few of the following for your own good. These softwares will help you with daily tasks.

1.	WinArchiver (just like winZip), this has a premium version but no need to buy it, it will still run forever.
1.	IDM, AKA Internet Download Manager, this one is paid but can help download things at true Insti Speed (without it, you get 1mbps, with it you get 16mbps). Cracks are available, but if you are like me, who does not uses cracks anymore, you can go for UGet, another downloader which is free.
1.	Notepad++ or Sublime. These are the text editors better than notepad when it comes to programming. If you nave never used any BETTER editors than notepad(I am not talking docx files no... just plain txts) then check Notepad++ first. It is free.
1.	VLC Media Player. This piece supports many formats of video. Don't stick with the default media players, please.
1.	Torch>Firefox>Chrome (sorry chrome, it's just me) <br>
	Some people say Torch>Chrome>Firefox and I can not prove them wrong. But yes!! Every one, Every one of them knows that any browser is better than Edge or IE (sorry Windows). 
1.	Avast Anti-Virus. Antivirus(free) to keep your computer safe.<br>
	P.S. I keep my important files online in safe places in safe accounts, so whenever anything goes wrong with my pc, I just format that b.... and reinstall OS.
1.	O yes, office 2007-2017. They are good editors, paid AF. You can get the cracks I guess on some place called DC.

Don't waste that i5/i7 processor and 2gb Graphics card on nothing. Try stuffs. Persnolaize your Personal Computer. Try softwares. Help others with things you tried. Also ignore this sentence but get ubuntu.
